        The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate
        existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the
        same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their
        pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new
        common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive
        translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform
        grammar, pronunciation and more common words.

      more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new
      common language will be more simple and regular than the existing
      European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will
      be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified
      English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental
      is.The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate
